	<h1>How to Cite Wildbook and Collaborative Data</h1>

	<p>Even if a collaborative link has been made between users, Wildbook requests you to contact the data provider(s)
		for use of any and all data shared in a collaboration if it is to be used in any publication, product, or
		commercial application.</p>

	<p>By using any Wildbook the user agrees to the following:
	<ol>
		<li>Not to use data contained in Wildbook in any publication, product, or commercial application without prior
			written consent of the original data provider.</li>
		<li>To cite both the data provider(s) and Wildbook appropriately after approval of use is obtained.
			<ul>
				<li>Collaborative datasets should list all data contributors in descending order of quantity of
					encounters contributed. The year should be listed as the year when the dataset was pooled and
					downloaded.</li>
				<li><b>Example citation for a dataset:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>S.Gero, J. Levenson, J. Van Oast., J Holmberg, A. Marine-Biologist, C. Researcher, O. Cean.
