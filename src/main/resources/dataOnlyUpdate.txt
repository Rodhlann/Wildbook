Hello! 

Just a quick e-mail to let you know that your whale shark encounter report has been classified as DATA-ONLY in the Whale Shark Photo-identification Library. This status indicates that we do not believe that we have enough data from the photographs submitted to identify this shark again in the future or from past observations. However, the data you submitted could still be very useful to the research community and will be retained.

If you have additional photographs that may be useful in helping us to identify this animal, please send them to webmaster@whaleshark.org and reference the encounter number listed below. Photos of the spot patterning behind the fifth gill (left or right-side) and of noticeable scarring can help us accurately identify each individual. You can learn more about the types of photographs that are useful for whale shark mark-recapture at:

Thanks again for your whale shark encounter report. We appreciate your effort to help us better understand and protect this amazing animal!

Sincerely,
Zaven Arzoumanian
President, Wild Me
