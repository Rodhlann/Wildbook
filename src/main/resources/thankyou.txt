Hello! 

Thank you for submitting data about your whale shark encounter. We will use this information to assist scientific research and global conservation initiatives. 

The information that you have submitted has been encapsulated in an "encounter" that we track.  Each encounter is assigned a unique number, and you can view that encounter at any time using the link below or by going to the Wildbook for Whale Sharks (http://www.whaleshark.org).

We will keep you informed of any changes to your submitted encounter, and email you if the shark is matched to another shark within the Wildbook database.  We will also let you know if/when and where your shark is re-sighted by other community members. 

Sincerely,

The Wild Me team
